Love it — making the CM5 the **brain** and leaving the pumps/sensors as separate “muscle” modules is the right architecture. Below I’ll give you a neat block diagram and a set of practical, opinionated **display options** with pros/cons, interfaces, software approaches, and recommended uses so you can pick the display that fits your product goals.

# 📺 Display options — pick by use-case

### 1) Small status + config (low-cost)

* **Type:** 0.96"–1.5" I²C/SPI OLED (SSD1306/SH1106) or small color TFT (ST7735)
* **Resolution:** 128×64 (OLED) or 128×160 (TFT)
* **Interface:** I²C or SPI
* **Pros:** tiny, cheap, easy to drive from ESP32 or CM5 via SPI; great for status icons, network/IP, small menus.
* **Cons:** poor for rich graphics or long text.
* **Use-case:** device status, IP, quick buttons, boot/health info.

### 2) Medium touch touchscreen (kiosk/local UI)

* **Type:** 5"–7" MIPI-DSI LCD with capacitive touch (or HDMI + USB touch)
* **Resolution:** 800×480 or 1024×600
* **Interface:** MIPI-DSI (preferred native on CM5 carriers) or HDMI + USB for touch
* **Pros:** full touch UI, good for a local Lovelace kiosk (Chromium in kiosk mode), comfortable for configuration.
* **Cons:** moderate power consumption, needs good enclosure and anti-glare for sunlight.
* **Use-case:** Local dashboard, setup/config screens, onsite control.

### 3) Larger display / wall-mounted dashboard

* **Type:** 10"–15" HDMI display / tablet display via HDMI
* **Resolution:** 1280×800 up to 1920×1080
* **Interface:** HDMI output from carrier
* **Pros:** lots of screen real estate for graphs (Grafana, HA), multi-card dashboards.
* **Cons:** largest power draw, needs a proper mounting solution.
* **Use-case:** central control panel, operations room, strong visualization.

### 4) Low-power, outdoor/field readout

* **Type:** e-ink (partial or full refresh) — 2.9"–7.5" ePaper
* **Interface:** SPI
* **Pros:** ultra-low power, sunlight readable, great for slow-changing status (daily soil summary).
* **Cons:** slow refresh, no animation, limited greyscale/color and refresh cycles.
* **Use-case:** remote kiosk, battery-powered site display for daily summaries.

### 5) High-visibility industrial display

* **Type:** 7" sunlight-readable transflective TFT or VGA/HDMI with anti-glare
* **Interface:** MIPI-DSI / HDMI
* **Pros:** readable outdoors; rugged options exist.
* **Cons:** cost and supply chain for rugged panels.
* **Use-case:** greenhouse control panel or outdoor rack.

# 🔌 Interfaces & practical notes

* **Prefer MIPI-DSI** for integrated mid-size touchscreens. CM5 carriers commonly expose DSI — it’s efficient and gives best performance for a compact touch display.
* **HDMI + USB touch** is the easiest route if you want standard off-the-shelf panels (especially >7").
* **SPI/I²C** is perfect for small status displays and e-ink but is limited in speed/resolution.
* **Touch controllers** usually appear as USB (for capacitive) or I²C (for cheaper resistive); ensure Linux driver support (FT5406, Goodix, etc.) or use USB controllers to minimize driver work.
* For  **e-ink** , pick vendors with Linux libraries or use existing userspace drivers (waveshare has many examples).
* If you want to run full HA frontend locally on the display, **Chromium in kiosk mode** is the usual approach:
  * Start Chromium pointing to `http://localhost:8123/lovelace/default_view?kiosk`
  * Use autostart systemd or kiosk script.
* For super low latency and lean UI, create a native GTK/Qt or Electron app that reads API from HA and renders custom UI.

# 🧩 Software integration options

1. **HA Lovelace (browser kiosk)**
   * Run Chromium/Kiosk on boot.
   * Best for quick integration with HA’s UI and dashboards.
2. **Local webapp (React/Vue)**
   * Run a bundled webserver on the CM5, display via Chromium.
   * Full control over layout/branding.
3. **Native app (Python + PyQT / Kivy)**
   * Lightweight, can run on framebuffer directly (no X/Wayland).
   * Good for dedicated, snappy UIs and offline usage.
4. **Grafana kiosk**
   * If your main visualization is Grafana, run a Grafana dashboard in kiosk mode on the display.
5. **e-ink summary renderer**
   * Use a cron job / Node-RED flow to generate an SVG/PNG and feed to e-ink driver once per hour/day.

# ⚙️ Power & thermal considerations

* **SSD + AI accelerator** => increases heat. Include a small fan or heatsink on CM5 and TPU.
* **Display power** : MIPI panels are power-efficient; HDMI monitors draw more current.
* **Backlight control** : route through PWM from carrier so you can dim or schedule off-times to save power.
* **Boot and resume** : design for quick boot or use watchdog/resume if display is critical.

# 🧾 Recommended parts (examples)

* Small status: SSD1306 128×64 OLED (I²C)
* Mid-size touchscreen: 7" MIPI-DSI 1024×600 capacitive + FT5406 touch controller
* Outdoor/low-power: 4.2" e-ink 400×300 SPI (partial refresh)
* Large: 10.1" HDMI 1280×800 with USB capacitive touch
* AI accel: Coral Edge TPU M.2 (if you want TF-Lite acceleration)

(You know your PCB skill — pick modules with known Linux support; prefer USB touch controllers and mainstream panel controllers.)

# ✅ Concrete suggestion (balanced)

If I had to pick one **balanced configuration** for your CM5 brain:

* **7" MIPI-DSI capacitive touch panel (1024×600)** for local UI
* **NVMe SSD** for InfluxDB + HA DB
* **M.2 Coral Edge TPU** for accelerated inference
* **USB port** available for optional HDMI or external devices
* Software: Home Assistant OS + Chromium kiosk launching Lovelace for local UI; Node-RED for flows; a small Python service to render occasional e-ink summaries (if used).

This gives you a compact, powerful local brain with a touch UI for onsite control, plus AI acceleration for the irrigation logic.
